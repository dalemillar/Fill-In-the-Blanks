Introduction to Programming Nanodegree

This is where you’ll learn how to program. You’ll learn a programming language called Python and you’ll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the project checkpoint you will write a program in Python to build a reverse Mad Libs game.
